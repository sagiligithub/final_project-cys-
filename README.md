ENHANCING WEB SECURITY WITH API AND TOKEN BASED AUTHENTICATION 
This project aims to create a serverless authentication system that securely handles user 
authentication and authorization. The system is built to be extremely scalable and secure, utilizing 
AWS cloud services like Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. The authentication involves 
user registration, login, token-based session handling, and access control for restricted pages. 
Using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), the system provides secure and stateless user sessions. 
Furthermore, API security controls like IAM roles and API keys are put in place to safeguard 
against unauthorized access.
